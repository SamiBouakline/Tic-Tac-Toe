# Tic-Tac-Toe (Java Swing)

A Java Swing program implementing a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game to explore 
event-driven programming, GUI design, and basic game logic.

## Overview
This project demonstrates:
- Handling user input through mouse clicks
- Tracking game state and detecting wins, ties, or draws
- Resetting the board automatically after each round
- Designing a simple graphical interface with Java Swing

The goal was to practice **object-oriented programming** and **event-driven design** 
in a small, interactive application.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay (X vs O)
- Automatic win/tie detection
- Auto-resetting board for continuous play
- Simple, intuitive GUI

## Technical Concepts
- Java Swing for GUI components and event handling
- State management for game logic
- Separation of concerns: UI vs game logic

## How to Run
Compile and run with a single command:
```bash
javac TicTacToe.java && java TicTacToe
